      <description>This one was a long time in the making. The case is cherry, the face plate and knobs are copper. The left knob is input select, center volume, and the right knob is a rotary dimmer switch for the (incandescent) backlight on the volume knob. Sounds absolutely beautiful, looks just as good, with more coats of polyurethane than I kept track of! Thanks to all of the people at diyaudio.com, especially BrianGT, who made the PCB boards I used, and to my then landlord Steve who let me use his shop.</description>

      <description>The second iteration of the headphone amp was the same internal design, packed into a slightly smaller, sleeker container. This one has a much more solid feel to it. It&amp;rsquo;s based on Chu Moy&amp;rsquo;s design; I checked the first iteration using a scope and it checks out nice, no clipping and the input/output resistances are good (100k in, theoretical 0 out.)
