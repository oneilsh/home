This book is based on a workshop I taught a few times at OSU, meant to introduce computer science theory to biologists. 

Digital version available online at [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/biorecursion).

Also available in print at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Bio-Recursion-Exploring-CS-Bioinformatics/dp/0692051694).

It introduces topics in programming, computer science, and bioinformatics via examples in the R programming language. While often associated with statistics, Bio/Recursion employs Râ€™s algorithmic capabilities to implement and visualize several fascinating methods, ranging from DNA alignment to drawing fractal trees.

Recursion (self-reference) provides a central theme, with topics spanning searching, sorting, data structures, proofs, fractals, and important bioinformatics algorithms.
