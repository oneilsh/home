### Work

My [CV](images/shawncv_2023_09_28_web.pdf). 

I am an Assistant Professor of Research with the [TISLab](https://tislab.org), [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi), and  [Center for Health AI](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/ai) at the [University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus](https://cuanschutz.edu/). In previous years I was a Senior Faculty Research Assistant with the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing (CGRB, now [CQLS](https://cqls.oregonstate.edu/)) at Oregon State University. I earned my Ph.D./M.S. in 2012/2009 from the University of Notre Dame in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and my Bachelors in Computer Science from Northern Michigan University in the beautiful Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

### Personal

My lovely wife Katie and I live in Corvallis, Oregon, with our two children Max and Colette, and two cats Sterling Cooper and Byron Bojangles IV.

I like woodworking, glass, photography and digital art, and more recently I've been tinkering with 3d printers, FPV drones, and similar gadgetry. I have a fondness for mathematical logic, hiking, martial arts, nerf blasters, and programming.
