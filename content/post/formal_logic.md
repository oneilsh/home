I also studied formal logic, under the direction of the amazing [Don Faust](https://www.nmu.edu/mathandcomputerscience/emeritus-faculty). I still recommend the book [What Is Mathematical Logic](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Logic-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486264041) for a good (but dense) overview of the topic. These are just some proofs I worked out.

* [Proof of deduction theorem](/logic/lemstar2.pdf)
* [Proof of a lemma used in proof of Completeness: Soundness implies Completeness](/logic/dedthm.pdf)
