### Work

My [CV](/bio_about/shawnres_2018_04_13.pdf). 

I am a Senior Faculty Research Assistant at the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing at Oregon State University. I earned my Ph.D. in 2012 from the University of Notre Dame, in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and my Bachelors in Computer Science from Northern Michigan University in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

### Personal

My lovely wife Katie and I live in Corvallis, Oregon, with our two cats Sterling Cooper (black) and Byron Bojangles IV (gray & white).

I like wood, glass, photography and digital art, and more recently I've been tinkering with 3d printers, FPV drones, and similar gadgetry. I have a fondness for mathematical logic, hiking, martial arts, nerf blasters, and programming.
