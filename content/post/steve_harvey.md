So, I was on TV once. My wife had contacted the Steve Harvey show suggesting I could use a wardrobe makeover. It was quite a surprise to me--we flew to Chicago for filming just a few days after I learned 
anything about it!

It was a ton of fun, and the Steve Harvey crew and show was a great experience. (And I got some nice clothes out of it.)
