Distributing large data files to all the nodes on a computing network is an important problem in large-scale scientific computing. We developed a more accurate mathematical model for this problem, and although we've shown minimum-time distribution to be NP-Hard (construction above), we've also developed a logarithmic approximation solution. 

This paper was initially presented at COCOON 2011, and later invited for submission to the Journal of Combinatorial Optimization. Thanks Michael Kowalczyk, NMU alum and current Prof, for the pic of me presenting!
