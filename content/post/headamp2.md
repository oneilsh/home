The second iteration of the headphone amp was the same internal design, packed into a slightly smaller, sleeker container. This one has a much more solid feel to it. 
It's based on [Chu Moy's design](https://tangentsoft.net/audio/cmoy/); I checked the first iteration using a scope and it checks out nice, no clipping and the input/output resistances are good (100k in, theoretical 0 out.)
