There's a pretty cool app called Codea, which is a programming IDE similar [processing.org](http://processing.org), but in Lua, on the iPad. 

Lua supports first-class functions, so I played around with designing a [parameterized 
L-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system#Parametric_grammars) which builds sentences as lists of closures.
