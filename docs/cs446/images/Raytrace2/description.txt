The raytracer. It works by "sending out" rays from eye point, determining what it hit by searching
through the list of objects, and then determining the color to put to the screen by checking to see
what color the object is, if its shiny, if it should be in shadow, etc. Note that this algorithm must
do a lot of checks for every object in the list for each pixel it prints, so it gets slow fast if there
are a lot of objects on the screen.
