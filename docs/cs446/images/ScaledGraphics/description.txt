Hmm, It's been a while since I did this one. The program uses some sort of "window" thing that I coded
to do the dirty work. Click on the object on top that you want to create, then click and drag below to
add it to the picture. The cloud thing is a polar curve, and the tree is a fractal tree. The house is
just a bunch of lines.
