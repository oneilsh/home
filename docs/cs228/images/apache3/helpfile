This is an application server. It pipes the results of
unix commands at a shell to the browser. The syntax goes like this:

http://server:port/command

Commands currently allowed are: echo, fortune, and man
If you want to have options to the commands, you could do
something like this:

http://server:port/fortune_wisdom
or
http://server:port/fortune_-o_drugs
or
http://server:port/echo_man_this_rocks
or
http://server:port/man_fortune
(That one gives you fortunes man page, this doesnt work so well though)

There is a limit to how many _ delimited options you can have,
but its like 20. So don't worry about it.

Oh and you can say 
http://server:port/fortune_subject
to get a fortune on a particular subjects. To get a list of these:
http://server:port/listfortunes

This message is displayed by trying a command of anything other
than echo, fortune, and man.
