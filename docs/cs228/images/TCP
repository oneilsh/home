PING PONG
	send an acknowledgement for each packet recieved, one outstanding packet each
	always acknowledge, even if you already got it, cuz maybe the last ack got lsot
	timer for the outstanding timer
	Advantages
		Dumb, simple
	Disadvantages
		Sucks on high latency link, because your waiting a lot
		
Selective Repeat
	send multiple chunks at once, reciever sends request for packets it didnt get		
	if the sender doesnt hear any reply, it resends everything it doesnt know the reciever has
	always acknowledge, even if you already got it, cuz maybe the last ack got lsot
	list of timers, one for each packet
	Advantages
		keeps the wire busy, always sends if theres stuff to send
		Good performance, even better than what we really use
		no unnesecary retransmits
	Disadvantages
		reciever must cache to keep data in order
		Complex, lots of error conditions to check for
		
The one invented last year - CRC algorithm
	sends checksums on the file, when the reciever has enough checksums (n bytes of checksum for n bytes of data)
	then sends ONE acknowlegdement
	Advantages
		low bandwidth requirements
		great in networks with lots of errors
	Disadvantages
		you dont know a single byte of the file untill you have them all, you cant
		process as you get them
		Super duper complex, rough on cpu's

Go Back N
	send off some packets, the acks are "staring from the beginning, what is t
	the highest numbered consequtive you got"
	list of timers, kill a timer and all the timers below when we get an ack



TCP
	uses go back N
	
Effects of Losing a packet
	double the round trip estimate
