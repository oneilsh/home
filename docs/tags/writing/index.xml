      <title>Bio/Recursion: CS and Bioinformatics in R</title>

      <description>This book is based on a workshop I taught a few times at OSU, meant to introduce computer science theory to biologists.
Digital version available online at Leanpub.
Also available in print at Amazon.
It introduces topics in programming, computer science, and bioinformatics via examples in the R programming language. While often associated with statistics, Bio/Recursion employs Râ€™s algorithmic capabilities to implement and visualize several fascinating methods, ranging from DNA alignment to drawing fractal trees.</description>

      <description>Read Online at Open Oregon State (Open-Access &amp;amp; Free!)
Or order a copy from Amazon or OSU Press. (Scribble in the margins!)
This Open-Access textbook was a collaboration with Open Oregon State and OSU Press. It aims to provide life scientists and students the skills necessary for research in a data-rich world. The text covers accessing and using remote servers via the command-line, writing programs and pipelines for data analysis, and provides useful vocabulary for interdisciplinary work.</description>

      <description>I also studied formal logic, under the direction of the amazing Don Faust. I still recommend the book What Is Mathematical Logic for a good (but dense) overview of the topic. These are just some proofs I worked out.

      <description>I took a Theory of Knowledge class as an undergraduate, and thoroughly enjoyed it. To this day I&amp;rsquo;m surprised how much epistemology is to be found at the intersection of science and engineering.
