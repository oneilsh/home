      <description>Work My CV.
I am an Assistant Professor of Research with the Center for Health AI at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. In previous years I was a Senior Faculty Research Assistant with the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing (CGRB, now CQLS) at Oregon State University. I earned my Ph.D./M.S. in 2012/2009 from the University of Notre Dame in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and my Bachelors in Computer Science from Northern Michigan University in the beautiful Upper Peninsula of Michigan.</description>

      <description>So, I was on TV once. My wife had contacted the Steve Harvey show suggesting I could use a wardrobe makeover. It was quite a surprise to me&amp;ndash;we flew to Chicago for filming just a few days after I learned anything about it!
It was a ton of fun, and the Steve Harvey crew and show was a great experience. (And I got some nice clothes out of it.)
