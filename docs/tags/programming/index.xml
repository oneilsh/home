      <title>Searching and Summarizing PubMed with LLMs</title>

      <description>What if an AI could perform a literature review for you? Here I illustrate using Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies for search and summarization. We use OpenAI&#39;s gpt-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT) and gpt-4 models, SentenceTransformers sentence embeddings, and the PubMed API to build a first-pass literature summarizer, that 1) designs an effective search query given a user question, 2) retrieves and indexes matching pubmed abstracts, 3) selects the top-matching abstracts for individual summarization in light of the original question, and 4) summarizes the summaries including references.</description>

      <title>TidyTensor - More Fun with Deep Learning</title>

      <description>TidyTensor is an R package for inspecting and manipulating tensors (multidimensional arrays). i It provides an improved print() function for summarizing structure, named tensors, conversion to data frames, and high-level manipulation functions. Designed to complement the excellent keras package, functionality is layered on top of base R types.
TidyTensor was inspired by a workshop I taught in deep learning with R, and a desire to explain and explore tensors in a more intuitive way.</description>

      <description>In an earlier post we considered machine learning “models” as functions producting predictions from data, and training models to be the production of these functions with higher-order functions. From there we built regression trees–models created recursively by determining 1) a splitting column (column 1 or 2 in this case), and 2) a good value in that column to split the dataset on. At each split, we find a column and value that produces two relatively homogenous sets of y values (in the sense that the values in each y subset can be well-predicted from the column values).</description>

      <description>I recently ran across this excellent article explaining gradient boosting in the context of regression trees. The article concludes by describing how the technique implements a gradient-descent process, but what I find most fascinating is the concept of “functional modeling”–building machine learning models from other models as building blocks.
This post explores that idea by implementing regression trees in base R (with a little visualization help from ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr) with functional programming concepts, including a technique called bootstrap aggregating.</description>

      <description>I’ve been studying up on deep learning recently (I know, trendy), and I learned something along the way that I think is just incredible.1
First, a little background: deep learning models are artificial neural networks, represented as potentially thousands of nodes with millions of weighted connections between them. Input numbers are fed in to some nodes on one side, and out pops output numbers from some nodes on the other side, after winding through the nodes and weighted connections.</description>

      <description>This book is based on a workshop I taught a few times at OSU, meant to introduce computer science theory to biologists.
Digital version available online at Leanpub.
Also available in print at Amazon.
It introduces topics in programming, computer science, and bioinformatics via examples in the R programming language. While often associated with statistics, Bio/Recursion employs R’s algorithmic capabilities to implement and visualize several fascinating methods, ranging from DNA alignment to drawing fractal trees.</description>

      <description>I’ve been teaching an evening class at the Oregon State University Craft Center in “3D modeling and printing.” I don’t know a ton about this topic, to be honest. But I know a little more than I did a year ago, and it was hard-earned knowledge. Why not share it?
At OSU it seems like I can’t walk out the door without bumping into a 3d printer (and students and faculty get access to them), but I found very little in-person information about how to do basic 3d design.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m (usually) a fan of the R programming language, though in a few ways it lacks features computer scientists expect. For example, R lacks many data structures provided by high-level languages, such as trees, queues, and stacks. This is somewhat complicated by R&amp;rsquo;s functional nature&amp;ndash;R programmers expect data structures to be &amp;ldquo;persistent,&amp;rdquo; such that previous versions of the structure are available even after insertions or deletions. Fortunately, data structures in purely-functional languages (generally not R) is a topic of past and ongoing research, spurred initially by Chris Okasaki&amp;rsquo;s excellent Purely Functional Data Structures.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a pretty cool app called Codea, which is a programming IDE similar processing.org, but in Lua, on the iPad.
Lua supports first-class functions, so I played around with designing a parameterized L-System which builds sentences as lists of closures.

      <title>Climate Change Adaptation</title>

      <description>Climate change is likely to have profound impacts on ecological systems, but in some important cases we&amp;rsquo;re still a long way from understanding exactly what those impacts might be. For instance, it has been posited that under warming, species in the northern hemisphere will be enhanced at their northern range edge (where presumably species are fitness-limited, and hence range-limited, by the cooler temperatures). Rather, recent research indicates that individual populations of some species may be locally adapted to their climatic environment, such that even these peripheral populations may decline with warming as they have developed an equilibrium with their environment.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in my day, the word &amp;ldquo;theory&amp;rdquo; meant something. So, in all my attempts to learn music theory, I was stymied by suggestions of memorizing seemingly unrelated collections of patterns, facts, and rediculous nomenclature. With dedication, books, wiki pages, and a good instructor (Ed Dee of Corvallis), though, I was able to make some progress. To help, I wrote a little program for exploring scales, notes, chords, and temperament.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TimelapseThing is a Python script that includes a number of tools for working with timelapse image series (in JPG format). It can be used to deflicker images (if some images in the series are mildy under- or over-exposed), merge a series of JPGs into a video, batch crop and resize, expand a series into a longer series, and lighten/darken/median merge using a sliding window approach (see below) for artistic effect and artifact removal (such as someone walking across your timelapse and getting caught in a frame). The heavy lifting is done using ImageMagick&amp;rsquo;s convert tool, and ffmpeg for video creation, so these tools are required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Assessing the quality and completeness of transcriptome assemblies is a challenge. For this problem, we developed a measure of gene assembly known as the &amp;ldquo;ortholog hit ratio.&amp;rdquo; First we associate each assembled gene with its closest match in a related organism. Then we compare the length of the matching region to the total length of the related gene. (Comparing the length of only the matching region ignores untranslated regions on the ends that are not considered part of the gene.</description>

      <description>When working with sequencing datasets of ecological interest, an interesting problem is how to tease out the genetic diversity present in the population being sequenced. Usually, assembly software simply aligns the short read sequences, and determines the consensus sequence based on the majority vote of each position. However, we may wish to seperately assemble each haplotype (version) of each gene.
We formulate this as a graph problem, where short reads that overlap are considered nodes in a graph that share an edge if they should go in different haplotypes.</description>

      <description>I did this project with Mike Olson, a Notre Dame graduate student. (He&amp;rsquo;s narrating the video.)
We studied the proper design of user interfaces in this class. Although we mostly focused on graphical interfaces, we also learned how to interface with motion-based systems such as the Nintendo Wii remote and Balance Board.
For our final project, we wanted to design an interactive browser for the Microsoft Surface, a multitouch based coffeetable like device.</description>

      <description>This was a project I did for Cryptography, which implemented a digital cash scheme as a web service. The idea behind digital cash is that, well, it&amp;rsquo;s digital cash. Which means, it&amp;rsquo;s a digital object which has value and can be traded/spent, but is also anonymous. This is accomplished via digital signatures. Alice, who has money in the bank, sends the bank an string of random letters and an amount to withdraw.</description>

      <description>I did this project with Allison Regier. It&amp;rsquo;s not too difficult to write a program which uses an exhaustive search to play a game. What this requires, though, is some way to evaluate one board against another to tell which moves to make. Usually such a comparison function is hand written.
We asked whether it was possible to write a generic board evaluation function which would learn a preference over board states by playing many games, either against itself or a hand coded evaluation function.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my earlier programming career, I was very interested in cellular automata and Braitenberg vehicles.
