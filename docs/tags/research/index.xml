      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m (usually) a fan of the R programming language, though in a few ways it lacks features computer scientists expect. For example, R lacks many data structures provided by high-level languages, such as trees, queues, and stacks. This is somewhat complicated by R&amp;rsquo;s functional nature&amp;ndash;R programmers expect data structures to be &amp;ldquo;persistent,&amp;rdquo; such that previous versions of the structure are available even after insertions or deletions. Fortunately, data structures in purely-functional languages (generally not R) is a topic of past and ongoing research, spurred initially by Chris Okasaki&amp;rsquo;s excellent Purely Functional Data Structures.</description>

      <title>Climate Change Adaptation</title>

      <description>Climate change is likely to have profound impacts on ecological systems, but in some important cases we&amp;rsquo;re still a long way from understanding exactly what those impacts might be. For instance, it has been posited that under warming, species in the northern hemisphere will be enhanced at their northern range edge (where presumably species are fitness-limited, and hence range-limited, by the cooler temperatures). Rather, recent research indicates that individual populations of some species may be locally adapted to their climatic environment, such that even these peripheral populations may decline with warming as they have developed an equilibrium with their environment.</description>

      <description>Distributing large data files to all the nodes on a computing network is an important problem in large-scale scientific computing. We developed a more accurate mathematical model for this problem, and although we&amp;rsquo;ve shown minimum-time distribution to be NP-Hard (construction above), we&amp;rsquo;ve also developed a logarithmic approximation solution.
This paper was initially presented at COCOON 2011, and later invited for submission to the Journal of Combinatorial Optimization. Thanks Michael Kowalczyk, NMU alum and current Prof, for the pic of me presenting!</description>

      <description>Assessing the quality and completeness of transcriptome assemblies is a challenge. For this problem, we developed a measure of gene assembly known as the &amp;ldquo;ortholog hit ratio.&amp;rdquo; First we associate each assembled gene with its closest match in a related organism. Then we compare the length of the matching region to the total length of the related gene. (Comparing the length of only the matching region ignores untranslated regions on the ends that are not considered part of the gene.</description>

      <description>When working with sequencing datasets of ecological interest, an interesting problem is how to tease out the genetic diversity present in the population being sequenced. Usually, assembly software simply aligns the short read sequences, and determines the consensus sequence based on the majority vote of each position. However, we may wish to seperately assemble each haplotype (version) of each gene.
We formulate this as a graph problem, where short reads that overlap are considered nodes in a graph that share an edge if they should go in different haplotypes.</description>

      <description>Much of the research I performed during my Master&amp;rsquo;s was on the newsvendor problem, which deals with attempting to guess the demand for short-lived products so as to maximize profits. Unfortunately, data about newspaper sales is tough to come by. So, why not use an online equivalent? This project aims at predicting the number of comments a Slashdot story will generate given text which appears in the summary.
However, since we are interested in looking at the number of comments as a demand for a product to be sold, we don&amp;rsquo;t stop there.</description>

      <title>Online Learning and the Newsvendor Problem</title>

      <description>Machine learning methods and inventory management were a focus in my Master&amp;rsquo;s work. In the newsvendor problem, an amount of product to order must be decided upon periodically for reselling. Ordering too much results in losses due to overstock which must be discarded; too little results in losses due to lost sales.
Traditional approaches experience a tradeoff in that some methods perform better in some situations, while our machine learning approach performs well consistently, particularly in situations where the demand suddenly increases or decreases.</description>
