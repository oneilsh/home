      <title>Searching and Summarizing PubMed with LLMs</title>

      <description>What if an AI could perform a literature review for you? Here I illustrate using Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies for search and summarization. We use OpenAI&#39;s gpt-3.5-turbo (ChatGPT) and gpt-4 models, SentenceTransformers sentence embeddings, and the PubMed API to build a first-pass literature summarizer, that 1) designs an effective search query given a user question, 2) retrieves and indexes matching pubmed abstracts, 3) selects the top-matching abstracts for individual summarization in light of the original question, and 4) summarizes the summaries including references.</description>

      <title>Regression Trees &amp; Bagging (more functional R)</title>

      <description>I recently ran across this excellent article explaining gradient boosting in the context of regression trees. The article concludes by describing how the technique implements a gradient-descent process, but what I find most fascinating is the concept of “functional modeling”–building machine learning models from other models as building blocks.
This post explores that idea by implementing regression trees in base R (with a little visualization help from ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr) with functional programming concepts, including a technique called bootstrap aggregating.</description>
