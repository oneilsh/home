      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know what made me think it would be a good idea to lug my heavy camera up to the top of South Sister to see the sunrise, but the photos at least turned out ok. Many thanks to Nathan Brown for organizing the trip.

      <title>Timelapse Thing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TimelapseThing is a Python script that includes a number of tools for working with timelapse image series (in JPG format). It can be used to deflicker images (if some images in the series are mildy under- or over-exposed), merge a series of JPGs into a video, batch crop and resize, expand a series into a longer series, and lighten/darken/median merge using a sliding window approach (see below) for artistic effect and artifact removal (such as someone walking across your timelapse and getting caught in a frame). The heavy lifting is done using ImageMagick&amp;rsquo;s convert tool, and ffmpeg for video creation, so these tools are required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
