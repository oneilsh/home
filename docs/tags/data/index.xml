      <description>This class was very interesting; we studied some of the basics of online algorithms as well as some applications to computational finance. Perhaps the most intriguing parts (for someone already familiar with online algorithms) were what we learned about classic computational finance, such as Black-Scholes-Merton.
This &amp;ldquo;project&amp;rdquo; is a review of the main result of an interesting paper, entitled &amp;ldquo;Making Decisions in the Face of Uncertainty: How to Pick a Winner Almost Every Time,&amp;rdquo; by Awerbuch et al.</description>

      <title>CSE60647 Data Mining, Predicting on Slashdot</title>

      <description>Much of the research I performed during my Master&amp;rsquo;s was on the newsvendor problem, which deals with attempting to guess the demand for short-lived products so as to maximize profits. Unfortunately, data about newspaper sales is tough to come by. So, why not use an online equivalent? This project aims at predicting the number of comments a Slashdot story will generate given text which appears in the summary.
However, since we are interested in looking at the number of comments as a demand for a product to be sold, we don&amp;rsquo;t stop there.</description>

      <title>CCSE60171 Artificial Intelligence, Learning to Play Games</title>

      <description>I did this project with Allison Regier. It&amp;rsquo;s not too difficult to write a program which uses an exhaustive search to play a game. What this requires, though, is some way to evaluate one board against another to tell which moves to make. Usually such a comparison function is hand written.
We asked whether it was possible to write a generic board evaluation function which would learn a preference over board states by playing many games, either against itself or a hand coded evaluation function.</description>
